#AlphaTris

This is the project for my Esperienze di Programmazione (Programming Experiences) exam at the University of Pisa.  

It is a command-line version of the Tris game (tic-tac-toe) with parametric grid size. It is implemented with a MiniMax-based 
algorithm with several algorithmic and coding optimizations.

The branch "original" is the project as it was delivered, the branch "english" is a version with comments in English.
